# raain-ui System Patterns

## System Architecture
The raain-ui library follows a modular, component-based architecture organized around several key concepts:

1. **Elements**: Core UI components that render visualizations (e.g., MapElement, DateStatusElement)
2. **Factories**: Classes that create and configure elements
3. **Inputs**: Data structures that define the configuration for elements
4. **Utils**: Utility functions for common operations
5. **Models**: Data structures that represent domain concepts

The architecture is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Components can be used independently
- **Extensible**: New components can be added without modifying existing ones
- **Testable**: Components have clear boundaries and dependencies
- **Performant**: Rendering is optimized for large datasets

## Key Technical Decisions

### Factory Pattern
The library uses the Factory pattern extensively to create and configure UI components. This provides several benefits:
- Encapsulates complex initialization logic
- Provides a consistent API for component creation
- Allows for future extension without breaking changes
- Simplifies testing through dependency injection

### Declarative Configuration
Components are configured through structured input objects rather than imperative method calls:
```typescript
const inputs = new DateStatusElementInput(
  datasets,
  focusDate,
  focusRange
);
```

This approach:
- Makes configuration explicit and self-documenting
- Enables serialization and deserialization of configurations
- Simplifies validation of input parameters

### Rendering Strategy
The library uses a combination of rendering technologies:
- **Leaflet**: For map-based visualizations
- **Pixi.js**: For high-performance canvas rendering
- **Chart.js**: For data charts and graphs
- **WebGL**: For 3D globe visualization

Each technology is chosen based on its strengths for specific visualization requirements.

## Design Patterns in Use

### Component Pattern
UI elements are self-contained components with:
- Clear public APIs
- Internal state management
- Lifecycle methods (build, update, destroy)
- Event handling

### Observer Pattern
Components use event listeners to communicate state changes:
```typescript
element.addEventListener('dateChange', (event) => {
  // Handle date change
});
```

### Strategy Pattern
Different visualization strategies can be applied based on data characteristics:
- Bar charts for discrete data
- Line charts for continuous data
- Heat maps for spatial data

### Adapter Pattern
The library includes adapters for integrating with different data sources and formats, particularly for the raain-model integration.

## Component Relationships

### Core Component Hierarchy
```
Element (abstract)
├── MapElement
│   └── EarthMapElement
├── DateStatusElement
│   └── DynamicDateStatusElement
└── [Other specialized elements]
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input Configuration**: Provided by the application
2. **Data Processing**: Transformation and preparation
3. **Rendering**: Visual representation
4. **User Interaction**: Events trigger updates
5. **State Changes**: May trigger re-rendering or data fetching

### Integration Points
- **raain-model**: For data structures and processing
- **DOM**: For rendering and user interaction
- **External APIs**: For map tiles, satellite imagery, etc.
