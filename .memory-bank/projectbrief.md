# raain-ui Project Brief

## Project Overview
raain-ui is a library that provides UI components and visualization layers for displaying and interacting with rainfall data. It serves as the frontend visualization toolkit for raain.io applications.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide reusable UI components for rainfall data visualization
2. Support map-based visualizations using Leaflet
3. Provide high-performance rendering using Pixi.js
4. Include charting capabilities using Chart.js
5. Support both 2D (Cartesian) and 3D (Earth) visualizations
6. Provide date-based navigation and status components
7. Maintain compatibility with raain-model for data integration

## Project Goals
- Create a comprehensive UI toolkit for rainfall data visualization
- Ensure high performance for large datasets
- Provide flexible and customizable components
- Support various integration scenarios (vanilla JS, Angular, etc.)
- Maintain clear documentation and examples

## Technical Scope
- TypeScript-based implementation
- Component-based architecture
- Support for modern browsers
- Modular design for selective importing
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Out of Scope
- Backend data processing
- Data collection mechanisms
- Authentication and authorization
- Application-specific business logic

## Success Criteria
- Components render correctly across supported browsers
- Performance meets or exceeds requirements for typical datasets
- Documentation covers all public APIs
- Example application demonstrates key features
- Tests provide adequate coverage of functionality
