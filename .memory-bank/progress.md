# raain-ui Progress

## What Works

### Core Components
- **MapElement**: Fully functional map visualization with Leaflet integration
- **EarthMapElement**: 3D globe visualization for global rainfall patterns
- **DateStatusElement**: Time-series visualization with variable time scales
- **DynamicDateStatusElement**: Enhanced version with async data loading
- **DateStatusUtils**: Utility functions for date handling and formatting

### Key Features
- Cartesian and polar visualizations for rainfall data
- Time-based navigation and filtering
- Layer management for multiple data sources
- Interactive controls for data exploration
- Integration with raain-model for data processing
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## What's Left to Build

### Planned Components

- Advanced filtering and data selection tools

### Feature Enhancements
- Further performance optimizations for very large datasets
- Enhanced customization options for visual styling
- More comprehensive event system for component interactions
- Additional integration options for different frameworks

## Current Status

### Version 2.3.8
The library is currently at version 2.3.8, which is a stable release with the following recent additions:
- DateStatusUtils for improved date handling
- Cartesian earth optimization for better performance
- Memory bank documentation for AI assistance
- Updated build process scripts

### Development Status
- Active development with regular updates
- Stable API with backward compatibility maintained
- Growing user base with feedback incorporated into development
- Comprehensive test suite with good coverage

### Documentation Status
- README provides comprehensive usage examples
- API documentation available in specs directory
- Example application demonstrates key features
- Development guidelines document available

## Known Issues

### Technical Limitations
- Large datasets can still cause performance issues in some browsers
- Some advanced features require WebGL support
- CSS integration can be challenging in certain frameworks
- Mobile touch interactions have some limitations

### Open Issues
- Edge cases in date handling for certain time zones
- Occasional rendering artifacts in complex visualizations
- Memory management challenges for long-running applications
- Some components have limited accessibility support

### Workarounds
- Data decimation techniques for large datasets
- Progressive loading for performance-intensive visualizations
- Documentation of CSS integration approaches for different frameworks
- Fallback rendering options for browsers without WebGL support
