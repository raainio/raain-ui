# raain-ui Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current development focus for raain-ui is on version 2.3.x, with emphasis on:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Improving rendering performance for large datasets, particularly for Cartesian earth visualizations
2. **Date Handling Improvements**: Enhancing date formatting and manipulation capabilities through DateStatusUtils
3. **Documentation Updates**: Improving documentation and examples to facilitate easier integration
4. **Build Process Improvements**: Enhancing the build and release process with new scripts

## Recent Changes

### Version 2.3.8 (Current)
- Added DateStatusUtils for improved date handling and formatting in DateStatusElement and DynamicDateStatusElement
- Implemented Cartesian earth optimization for improved performance
- Added memory bank documentation for AI assistance
- Updated build process scripts in the `scripts/bp/` directory
- Renamed package.raain.json to package.raainio.json for consistency

### Previous Significant Changes
- Model polar visualization improvements (v2.2.x)
- Support for icons in composite layers (v2.1.x)
- Updated raain-model integration (v2.0.x)

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities
1. Continue performance optimizations for large datasets
2. Enhance documentation with more examples
3. Improve test coverage for newer components
4. Address any reported issues with DateStatusUtils implementation

### Medium-term Goals
1. Explore additional visualization types for rainfall data
2. Improve accessibility of UI components
3. Enhance mobile support for all components
4. Investigate integration with additional mapping providers

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **TypeScript Migration**: Continuing to migrate older JavaScript code to TypeScript for improved type safety
2. **Dependency Management**: Carefully managing dependencies to balance functionality with bundle size
3. **Browser Support**: Focusing on modern browsers while maintaining reasonable backward compatibility
4. **Performance vs. Features**: Balancing the addition of new features with performance considerations

### Architecture Considerations
1. **Component Granularity**: Determining the appropriate level of granularity for components
2. **API Design**: Ensuring APIs are intuitive and consistent across components
3. **Testing Strategy**: Enhancing test coverage while keeping test maintenance manageable
4. **Documentation Approach**: Finding the right balance of documentation detail vs. maintenance effort

### Integration Considerations
1. **Framework Compatibility**: Ensuring components work well in various frameworks (vanilla JS, Angular, React)
2. **CSS Handling**: Addressing challenges with CSS imports in different build systems
3. **Dependency Injection**: Providing flexibility in how dependencies are provided to components
