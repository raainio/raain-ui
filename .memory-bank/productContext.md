# raain-ui Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The raain-ui library exists to provide specialized visualization components for rainfall data that can be integrated into various applications. Traditional visualization libraries lack specific features needed for effective rainfall data representation, such as:
- Time-series visualization with variable time scales (minutes to centuries)
- Geospatial mapping of rainfall intensity
- 3D globe visualization for global rainfall patterns
- Interactive components for exploring rainfall data across time and space

By creating a dedicated UI library for rainfall visualization, raain.io applications can provide consistent, high-quality user experiences with optimized performance for rainfall-specific data patterns.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Complex Data Visualization**: Rainfall data is multi-dimensional (time, location, intensity) and requires specialized visualization techniques.
2. **Performance Challenges**: Large rainfall datasets can be performance-intensive to render and interact with.
3. **Consistency Across Applications**: Multiple raain.io applications need consistent UI components and interaction patterns.
4. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating multiple visualization libraries (maps, charts, 3D) is complex and can lead to inconsistencies.
5. **Specialized Interaction Patterns**: Rainfall data exploration requires specific interaction patterns (time navigation, layer toggling, etc.).

## How It Should Work
The library follows these key principles:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Each visualization element is a self-contained component that can be used independently.
2. **Factory Pattern**: Components are created through factory classes that handle initialization and configuration.
3. **Declarative Configuration**: Components are configured through clear input objects rather than imperative method calls.
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works out of the box, with options for advanced customization.
5. **Responsive Design**: Components adapt to different screen sizes and device capabilities.
6. **Performance Optimization**: Rendering is optimized for large datasets through techniques like data decimation and WebGL acceleration.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Users should understand how to interact with visualizations without extensive training.
- **Responsive**: Interactions should feel immediate, with appropriate loading indicators for longer operations.
- **Informative**: Visualizations should clearly communicate rainfall patterns and insights.
- **Consistent**: Similar interactions should work consistently across different components.
- **Accessible**: Components should support keyboard navigation and screen readers where possible.
- **Customizable**: Visual appearance should be customizable to match the host application's design.
